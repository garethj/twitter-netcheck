This is a simple Python script that detects changes in your internet connection status opening an HTTP connection to a specified URL. Changes can then be published automatically to Twitter and as a direct message to a Twitter user.

Note that this requires [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) to be able to publish to Twitter from Python.
